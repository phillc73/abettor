`abettor` is an R package for connecting to the online betting exchange Betfair, via their API-NG product, using JSON-RPC. The package can be used to retrieve market information, place bets, cancel bets and manage account information such as balance, statement and P&L.

The breadth of API calls covered is growing, although not yet complete. If your use case is not yet covered, raise an [issue](https://github.com/phillc73/abettor/issues) or write new functionality yourself. New contributors always welcome.

## Quick start

### Install

Install from GitLab

```r
# install.packages("remotes")
library("remotes")
remotes::install_gitlab("phillc73/abettor")
library("abettor")
```
Or install from GitHub if you prefer (identical mirror of GitLab)

```r
# install.packages("remotes")
library("remotes")
remotes::install_github("phillc73/abettor")
library("abettor")
```

### Obtain a Betfair Developer Application Key

Betfair provided instructions to obtain an Application Key are [available here](https://docs.developer.betfair.com/display/1smk3cen4v3lu3yomq5qye0ni/Application+Keys), or follow the steps in the Place a Bet Tutorial linked below.

The `abettor` package is an aid to developing Betfair applications in R. Developers will still need to apply for a [Betfair Software Vendor Licence](https://developer.betfair.com/en/vendor-program/the-process/) should they wish to develop commercial software using this package. Personal use of the `abettor` package will only require a Betfair Application Key.

### Required Packages

Only two additional R packages are required.

```r
# Requires a minimum of version 1.7.2
library("jsonlite")
# Requires a minimum of version 1.4.2
library("httr")
```
