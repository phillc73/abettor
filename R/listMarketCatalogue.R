#' Return listMarketCatalogue data
#'
#' \code{listMarketCatalogue} returns in-depth market data.
#'
#' \code{listMarketCatalogue} returns in-depth market data and can be filtered
#' via the API-NG based on a number of arguments. Using Horse Racing as an
#' example, complete race cards are returned for the specified markets. No
#' pricing data is returned via \code{listMarketCatalogue}. By default,
#' \code{listMarketCatalogue} returns are limited to the forthcoming 24-hour
#' period. However, this can be changed by user specified date/time stamps.
#'
#' The output of \code{listMarketCatalogue} is complex and contains all data
#' about the requested markets, apart from price. A full description of this
#' output may be found here:

#' @seealso \code{\link{loginBF}}, which must be executed first.
#'
#' @param eventTypeIds vector <String>. Restrict markets by event type
#'   associated with the market. (i.e., Football, Horse Racing, etc). Accepts
#'   multiple IDs (See examples). IDs can be obtained via
#'   \code{\link{listEventTypes}}. Required. No default.
#'
#' @param marketTypeCodes vector <String>. Restrict to markets that match the
#'   type of the market (i.e. MATCH_ODDS, HALF_TIME_SCORE). You should use this
#'   instead of relying on the market name as the market type codes are the same
#'   in all locales. Accepts multiple market type codes (See examples). Market
#'   codes can be obtained via \code{\link{listMarketTypes}}, Required. No
#'   default.
#'
#' @param maxResults Integer. Limit on the total number of results returned,
#'   must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000. Optional. If not
#'   defined, defaults to 200.
#'
#' @param fromDate The start date from which to return matching events. Format
#'   is \%Y-\%m-\%dT\%TZ, tz = "UTC". Times must be submitted in UTC as this is what is used
#'   by Betfair. Optional. If not defined defaults to current system
#'   date and time minus 2 hours (to allow searching of all in-play football
#'   matches).
#'
#' @param toDate The end date to stop returning matching events. Format is
#'   \%Y-\%m-\%dT\%TZ, tz = "UTC". Times must be submitted in UTC as this is what is used
#'   by Betfair. Optional. If not defined defaults to the current system
#'   date and time plus 24 hours.
#'
#' @param eventIds vector <String>. Restrict to markets that are associated with
#'   the specified eventIDs (e.g. "27675602"). Optional. Default is NULL.
#'
#' @param competitionIds vector <String>. Restrict to markets that are
#'   associated with the specified competition IDs (e.g. EPL = "31", La Liga =
#'   "117"). Optional. Default is NULL.
#'
#' @param marketIds vector <String>. Restrict to markets that are associated
#'   with the specified marketIDs (e.g. "1.122958246"). Optional. Default is
#'   NULL.
#'
#' @param marketCountries vector <String>. Restrict to markets that are in the
#'   specified country or countries. Accepts multiple country codes (See
#'   examples). Codes can be obtained via \code{\link{listCountries}}. Optional.
#'   Default is NULL.
#'
#' @param venues vector <String>. Restrict markets by the venue associated with
#'   the market. This functionality is currently only available for horse racing
#'   markets (e.g.venues=c("Exeter","Navan")). Optional. Default is NULL.
#'
#' @param bspOnly Boolean. Restrict to betfair staring price (bsp) markets only,
#'   if TRUE or non-bsp markets if FALSE. Optional. Default is NULL, which means
#'   that both bsp and non-bsp markets are returned.
#'
#' @param turnInPlayEnabled Boolean. Restrict to markets that will turn in play
#'   if TRUE or will not turn in play if FALSE. Optional. Default is NULL, which
#'   means that both market types are returned.
#'
#' @param inPlayOnly Boolean. Restrict to markets that are currently in play if
#'   TRUE or not inplay if FALSE. Optional. Default is NULL, which means that
#'   both inplay and non-inplay markets are returned.
#'
#' @param marketBettingTypes vector <String>. Restrict to markets that match the
#'   betting type of the market (i.e. Odds, Asian Handicap Singles, or Asian
#'   Handicap Doubles). Optional. Default is NULL. See
#'   \url{https://api.developer.betfair.com/services/webapps/docs/display/1smk3cen4v3lu3yomq5qye0ni/Betting+Enums#BettingEnums-MarketBettingType}
#'    for a full list (and description) of viable parameter values.
#'
#' @param withOrders String. Restrict to markets in which the user has bets of a
#'   specified status. The two viable values are "EXECUTION_COMPLETE" (an order
#'   that does not have any remaining unmatched portion) and "EXECUTABLE" (an
#'   order that has a remaining unmatched portion). Optional. Default is NULL.
#'
#' @param marketSort String. Determines the order of the results. Optional.
#'   Default value is NULL, which Betfair converts to "RANK". "RANK" is an
#'   assigned priority that is determined by the Betfair Market Operations team
#'   in their back-end system. A result's overall rank is derived from the
#'   ranking given to the following attributes for the result: EventType,
#'   Competition, StartTime, MarketType, MarketId. For example, EventType is
#'   ranked by the most popular sports types and marketTypes are ranked in the
#'   following order: ODDS ASIAN LINE RANGE If all other dimensions of the
#'   result are equal, then the results are ranked in MarketId order. See
#'   \url{https://api.developer.betfair.com/services/webapps/docs/display/1smk3cen4v3lu3yomq5qye0ni/Betting+Enums#BettingEnums-MarketSort}
#'    for a full list (and description) of viable parameter values.
#'
#' @param marketProjection vector <String>. Determines the type and amount of
#'   data returned about the market. By default all data, except "MARKET
#'   DESCRIPTION", is included. See
#'   \url{https://api.developer.betfair.com/services/webapps/docs/display/1smk3cen4v3lu3yomq5qye0ni/Betting+Enums#BettingEnums-MarketProjection}
#'    for a full list (and description) of all parameter values.
#'
#' @param textQuery String. Restrict markets by any text associated with the
#'   market such as the Name, Event, Competition, etc. The string can include a
#'   wildcard (*) character as long as it is not the first character. Optional.
#'   Default is NULL.
#'
#' @param suppress Boolean. By default, this parameter is set to FALSE, meaning
#'   that a warning is posted when the listMarketCatalogue call throws an error.
#'   Changing this parameter to TRUE will suppress this warning.
#'
#' @param sslVerify Boolean. This argument defaults to TRUE and is optional. In
#'   some cases, where users have a self signed SSL Certificate, for example
#'   they may be behind a proxy server, Betfair will fail login with "SSL
#'   certificate problem: self signed certificate in certificate chain". If this
#'   error occurs you may set sslVerify to FALSE. This does open a small
#'   security risk of a man-in-the-middle intercepting your login credentials.
#'
#' @return Response from Betfair is stored in listMarketCatalogue variable,
#'   which is then parsed from JSON as a list. Only the first item of this list
#'   contains the required event type identification details.
#'
#' @section Note on \code{listMarketCatalogueOps} variable: The
#'   \code{listMarketCatalogueOps} variable is used to firstly build an R data
#'   frame containing all the data to be passed to Betfair, in order for the
#'   function to execute successfully. The data frame is then converted to JSON
#'   and included in the HTTP POST request. If the listMarketCatalogue call throws
#'   an error, a data frame containing error information is returned.
