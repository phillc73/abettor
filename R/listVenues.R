#' Return Venues data
#'
#' \code{listVenues} simply lists all venues associated with the selected
#' parameters (e.g. horse racing venues with markets closing in the next 24 hours).
#' Note: Currently, only horse racing markets are associated with a venue.
#'
#' @seealso \code{\link{loginBF}}, which must be executed first.
#'
#' @param eventTypeIds vector <String>. Restrict venues by event type
#'   associated with the market. (e.g., Football = 1, Horse Racing = 7, etc).
#'   Accepts multiple IDs. IDs can be obtained via
#'   \code{\link{listEventTypes}}. Optional. Default is 7 (Horse Racing).
#'
#' @param marketTypeCodes vector <String>. Restrict to venues that match the
#'   type of the market (i.e. MATCH_ODDS, HALF_TIME_SCORE). You should use this
#'   instead of relying on the market name as the market type codes are the same
#'   in all locales. Accepts multiple market type codes. Market type codes can be
#'   obtained via \code{\link{listMarketTypes}}. Optional. Default is NULL.
#'
#' @param fromDate The start date from which to return matching venues.
#'   Format is \%Y-\%m-\%dT\%TZ, tz = "UTC". Times must be submitted in UTC as this is what is used
#'   by Betfair. Optional. If not defined, it defaults to
#'   current system date and time minus 2 hours (to allow searching of all
#'   in-play football matches).
#'
#' @param toDate The end date to stop returning matching venues. Format is
#'   \%Y-\%m-\%dT\%TZ, tz = "UTC". Times must be submitted in UTC as this is what is used
#'   by Betfair. Optional. If not defined defaults to the current system
#'   date and time plus 24 hours.
#'
#' @param eventIds vector <String>. Restrict to venues that are associated
#'   with the specified eventIDs (e.g. "27675602"). Optional. Default is NULL.
#'
#' @param competitionIds vector <String>. Restrict to market types that are
#'   associated with the specified competition IDs (e.g. EPL = "31", La Liga =
#'   "117"). Competition IDs can obtained via \code{\link{listCompetitions}}.
#'   Optional. Default is NULL.
#'
#' @param marketIds vector <String>. Restrict to venues that are associated
#'   with the specified marketIDs (e.g. "1.122958246"). Optional. Default is
#'   NULL.
#'
#' @param marketCountries vector <String>. Restrict to venues that are in the
#'   specified country or venues. Accepts multiple country codes. Codes can
#'   be obtained via \code{\link{listCountries}}. Optional. Default is NULL.
#'
#' @param venues vector <String>. Restrict venues by the venue associated
#'   with the market. This functionality is currently only available for horse
#'   racing markets (e.g.venues=c("Exeter","Navan")). Optional. Default is NULL.
#'
#' @param bspOnly Boolean. Restrict to betfair staring price (bsp) venues
#'   only if TRUE or non-bsp events if FALSE. Optional. Default is NULL, which
#'   means that both bsp and non-bsp venues are returned.
#'
#' @param turnInPlayEnabled Boolean. Restrict to venues that will turn in
#'   play if TRUE or will not turn in play if FALSE. Optional. Default is NULL,
#'   which means that both venues are returned.
#'
#' @param inPlayOnly Boolean. Restrict to venues that are currently in play
#'   if TRUE or not inplay if FALSE. Optional. Default is NULL, which means that
#'   both inplay and non-inplay venues are returned.
#'
#' @param marketBettingTypes vector <String>. Restrict to venues that match
#'   the betting type of the market (i.e. Odds, Asian Handicap Singles, or Asian
#'   Handicap Doubles). Optional. Default is NULL. See
#'   \url{https://api.developer.betfair.com/services/webapps/docs/display/1smk3cen4v3lu3yomq5qye0ni/Betting+Enums#BettingEnums-MarketBettingType}
#'    for a full list (and description) of viable parameter values.
#'
#' @param withOrders String. Restrict to venues in which the user has bets of
#'   a specified status. The two viable values are "EXECUTION_COMPLETE" (an
#'   order that does not have any remaining unmatched portion) and "EXECUTABLE"
#'   (an order that has a remaining unmatched portion). Optional. Default is
#'   NULL.
#'
#' @param textQuery String. Restrict venues by any text associated with the
#'   event type, such as the Name, Event, Competition, etc. The string can
#'   include a wildcard (*) character as long as it is not the first character.
#'   Optional. Default is NULL.
#'
#' @param suppress Boolean. By default, this parameter is set to FALSE, meaning
#'   that a warning is posted when the listVenues call throws an error.
#'   Changing this parameter to TRUE will suppress this warning.
#'
#' @param sslVerify Boolean. This argument defaults to TRUE and is optional. In
#'   some cases, where users have a self signed SSL Certificate, for example
#'   they may be behind a proxy server, Betfair will fail login with "SSL
#'   certificate problem: self signed certificate in certificate chain". If this
#'   error occurs you may set sslVerify to FALSE. This does open a small
#'   security risk of a man-in-the-middle intercepting your login credentials.
#'
#' @return Response from Betfair is stored in the listVenues variable, which
#'   is then parsed from JSON as a list. Only the first item of this list
#'   contains the required event type identification details. If the
#'   listVenues call throws an error, a data frame containing error
#'   information is returned.
#'
#' @section Note on \code{listVenuesOps} variable: The
#'   \code{listVenuesOps} variable is used to firstly build an R data frame
#'   containing all the data to be passed to Betfair, in order for the function
#'   to execute successfully. The data frame is then converted to JSON and
#'   included in the HTTP POST request.
#'

#' # Return all horse racing venues (and number of
#' corresponding markets) for the upcoming day.
#' listVenues()
#'
#' # Return upcoming horse racing venues in Great Britain.
