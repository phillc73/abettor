\title{Logout from the Betfair API.}
\usage{
logoutBF(suppress = TRUE, sslVerify = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{suppress}{Boolean. \code{RCurl::postForm} posts a warning due to a
lack of inputs. By default, this parameter is set to TRUE, meaning this
warning is suppressed. Changing this parameter to FALSE will result in warnings
being posted.}

\item{sslVerify}{Boolean. This argument defaults to TRUE and is optional. In
some cases, where users have a self signed SSL Certificate, for example
they may be behind a proxy server, Betfair will fail login with "SSL
certificate problem: self signed certificate in certificate chain". If this
error occurs you may set sslVerify to FALSE. This does open a small
security risk of a man-in-the-middle intercepting your login credentials.}
}
\value{
Similar to \code{\link{loginBF}}, the call output is parsed from JSON
  as a list, from which the statuses SUCCESS or FAIL and error, if it is
  not null are returned as a colon seperated concatenated string. For error
  values, see

\examples{
\dontrun{

The last logout in this block will return an error. The first logout terminates
the session, meaning there is no session to end on the second logout request.

  function requires a valid session token
