\arguments{
\item{eventTypeIds}{vector <String>. Restrict competitions by event type
associated with the market. (e.g., Football = 1, Horse Racing = 7, etc).
Accepts multiple IDs (See examples). IDs can be obtained via
\code{\link{listEventTypes}}. Required. No default.}

\item{marketTypeCodes}{vector <String>. Restrict to competitions that match
the type of the market (i.e. MATCH_ODDS, HALF_TIME_SCORE). You should use
this instead of relying on the market name as the market type codes are the
same in all locales. Accepts multiple market type codes (See examples).
Market type codes can be obtained via \code{\link{listMarketTypes}}.
Optional. Default is NULL.}

\item{fromDate}{The start date from which to return matching competitions.
Format is \%Y-\%m-\%dT\%TZ, tz = "UTC". Times must be submitted in UTC as this is what is used
by Betfair. Optional. If not defined, it defaults to
current system date and time minus 2 hours (to allow searching of all
in-play football matches).}

\item{toDate}{The end date to stop returning matching competitions. Format is
\%Y-\%m-\%dT\%TZ, tz = "UTC". Times must be submitted in UTC as this is what is used
by Betfair. Optional. If not defined defaults to the current system
date and time plus 24 hours.}

\item{eventIds}{vector <String>. Restrict to competitions that are associated
with the specified eventIDs (e.g. "27675602"). Optional. Default is NULL.}

\item{competitionIds}{vector <String>. Restrict to competitions that are
associated with the specified competition IDs (e.g. EPL = "31", La Liga =
"117"). Competition IDs can obtained via \code{\link{listCompetitions}}.
Optional. Default is NULL.}

\item{marketIds}{vector <String>. Restrict to competitions that are
associated with the specified marketIDs (e.g. "1.122958246"). Optional.
Default is NULL.}

\item{marketCountries}{vector <String>. Restrict to competitions that are in
the specified country or countries. Accepts multiple country codes. Codes
can be obtained via \code{\link{listCountries}}. Optional. Default is NULL.}

\item{venues}{vector <String>. Restrict competitions by the venue associated
with the market. This functionality is currently only available for horse
racing markets (e.g.venues=c("Exeter","Navan")).  Codes can be obtained
via \code{\link{listVenues}}. Optional. Default is NULL.}

\item{bspOnly}{Boolean. Restrict to betfair staring price (bsp) competitions
only if TRUE or non-bsp events if FALSE. Optional. Default is NULL, which
means that both bsp and non-bsp competitions are returned.}

\item{turnInPlayEnabled}{Boolean. Restrict to competitions that will turn in
play if TRUE or will not turn in play if FALSE. Optional. Default is NULL,
which means that both competitions are returned.}

\item{inPlayOnly}{Boolean. Restrict to competitions that are currently in
play if TRUE or not inplay if FALSE. Optional. Default is NULL, which means
that both inplay and non-inplay competitions are returned.}

\item{marketBettingTypes}{vector <String>. Restrict to competitions that
match the betting type of the market (i.e. Odds, Asian Handicap Singles, or
Asian Handicap Doubles). Optional. Default is NULL. See
\url{https://api.developer.betfair.com/services/webapps/docs/display/1smk3cen4v3lu3yomq5qye0ni/Betting+Enums#BettingEnums-MarketBettingType}
 for a full list (and description) of viable parameter values.}

\item{withOrders}{String. Restrict to competitions in which the user has bets
of a specified status. The two viable values are "EXECUTION_COMPLETE" (an
order that does not have any remaining unmatched portion) and "EXECUTABLE"
(an order that has a remaining unmatched portion). Optional. Default is
NULL.}

\item{textQuery}{String. Restrict competitions by any text associated with
the event type, such as the Name, Event, Competition, etc. The string can
include a wildcard (*) character as long as it is not the first character.
Optional. Default is NULL.}

\item{suppress}{Boolean. By default, this parameter is set to FALSE, meaning
that a warning is posted when the listCompetitions call throws an error.
Changing this parameter to TRUE will suppress this warning.}

\item{sslVerify}{Boolean. This argument defaults to TRUE and is optional. In
some cases, where users have a self signed SSL Certificate, for example
they may be behind a proxy server, Betfair will fail login with "SSL
certificate problem: self signed certificate in certificate chain". If this
error occurs you may set sslVerify to FALSE. This does open a small
security risk of a man-in-the-middle intercepting your login credentials.}
}
\value{
Response from Betfair is stored in the listCompetitions variable,
  which is then parsed from JSON as a list. Only the first item of this list
  contains the required event type identification details. If the
  listCompetitions call throws an error, a data frame containing error
  information is returned.
}
\description{
\code{listCompetitions} simply lists all competitions associated with the
selected parameters (e.g. soccer competitions with markets closing in the
next 24 hours). This data is useful for finding specific event identifiers
(e.g. EPL = 31, Champions League = 228), which are then usually passed to
further functions. By default, \code{listCompetitions} returns are limited to
the forthcoming 24-hour period. However, this can be changed by user
specified date/time stamps.
}
\section{Note on \code{listCompetitionsOps} variable}{
 The
  \code{listCompetitionsOps} variable is used to firstly build an R data
  frame containing all the data to be passed to Betfair, in order for the
  function to execute successfully. The data frame is then converted to JSON
  and included in the HTTP POST request.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Return all football and tennis competitions (and number of
corresponding markets) for the upcoming day.
listCompetitions(eventTypeIds = c("1","2"))

# Return competitions that currently have at least one football market inplay.
listCompetitions(eventTypeIds = c("1"),inPlayOnly=TRUE)

# Return upcoming competitions that allow Betfair starting prices (BSPs) on
specific football markets.
listCompetitions(eventTypeIds = c("1"),bspOnly=TRUE)
