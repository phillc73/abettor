\usage{
listMarketPandL(
  marketIds,
  includeSettledBetsValue = NULL,
  includeBspBetsValue = NULL,
  netOfCommissionValue = NULL,
  suppress = FALSE,
  sslVerify = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{marketIds}{Vector<String>. A set of market ID strings from which the
corresponding market profit and losses will be returned. Required.
No default.}

\item{includeSettledBetsValue}{Boolean. Option to include settled bets
(partially settled markets only). This parameter defaults to NULL, which
Betfair interprets as false. Optional.}

\item{includeBspBetsValue}{Boolean. Option to include Betfair Starting Price
(BSP) bets. This parameter defaults to NULL, which Betfair interprets as
FALSE. Optional.}

\item{netOfCommissionValue}{Boolean. Option to return profit and loss net of
user's current commission rate for this market, including any special
tariffs. This parameter defaults to NULL, which Betfair interprets as
FALSE. Optional.}

\item{suppress}{Boolean. By default, this parameter is set to FALSE, meaning
that a warning is posted when the listMarketPandL call throws an error.
Changing this parameter to TRUE will suppress this warning.}

\item{sslVerify}{Boolean. This argument defaults to TRUE and is optional. In
some cases, where users have a self signed SSL Certificate, for example
they may be behind a proxy server, Betfair will fail login with "SSL
certificate problem: self signed certificate in certificate chain". If this
error occurs you may set sslVerify to FALSE. This does open a small
security risk of a man-in-the-middle intercepting your login credentials.}
}
\value{
Response from Betfair is stored in listPandL variable, which is then
  parsed from JSON as a data frame of at least two varialbes (more if the
  optional parameters are included). The first column records the market IDs,
  while the corresponding market P&Ls are stored within a list.

\description{
\code{listMarketPandL} Retrieve profit and loss for a given list of OPEN
markets. The values are calculated using matched bets and optionally settled
bets
}
\section{Note on \code{listPandLOps} variable}{
 The
  \code{listPandLOps} variable is used to firstly build an R data frame
  containing all the data to be passed to Betfair, in order for the function
  to execute successfully. The data frame is then converted to JSON and
  included in the HTTP POST request. If the listMarketPandL call throws an
  error, a data frame containing error information is returned.

\dontrun{
Return the P&L (net of comission) for the requested markets. The actual
market IDs are unlikely to work and are just for demonstration purposes.

listMarketPandL(marketIds = c("1.122323121","1.123859413"),
               netOfCommission = TRUE)

\code{\link{loginBF}}, which must be executed first. Do NOT use the
  DELAY application key. The DELAY application key does not support price
  data.

\code{\link{listClearedOrders}} to retrieve your profit and loss for
  CLOSED markets

  Note that \code{listMarketPandL} does not include any information about the
  value of your bets on the markets e.g. value of profit/loss if you were to
  cashout at current prices. It simply returns the money you'd win/lose if
  specific selections were to win. If you wish to calculate your cashout
  position, then we'll need to design a new function combining
  \code{listCurrentOrders} and \code{listMarketBook} (it's on the to-do
  list).
