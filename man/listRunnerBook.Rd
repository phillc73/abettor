\arguments{
\item{marketId}{String. The market identification number of the required
event. IDs can be obtained via \code{\link{listMarketCatalogue}}. Required.
No default.}

\item{selectionId}{String. The selection (runner) identification number of
the required event.
IDs can be obtained via \code{\link{listMarketCatalogue}}.
Required. No default.}

\item{handicap}{Double. The handicap applied to the selection, if on an
asian-style market. Optional. Defaults to 0, meaning no handicap.
\code{handicap} must only be manually specified if betting on an Asian-style
market. Optional. Default is NULL.}

\item{priceData}{String. Supports five price data types, one of which must be
specified. Valid price data types are SP_AVAILABLE, SP_TRADED,
EX_BEST_OFFERS, EX_ALL_OFFERS and EX_TRADED. Must be upper case. See note
below explaining each of these options. Optional. Default is NULL.}

\item{bestPricesDepth}{Integer. The maximum number of prices to return on
each side for each runner. The default value is 3.}

\item{rollupModel}{String. Determines the model to use when rolling up
available sizes. The viable parameter values are "STAKE" (the volumes will
be rolled up to the minimum value, which is >= rollupLimit); "PAYOUT" (the
volumes will be rolled up to the minimum value, where the payout( price *
volume ) is >= rollupLimit); "MANAGED_LIABILITY" (the volumes will be
rolled up to the minimum value which is >= rollupLimit, until a lay price
threshold. There after, the volumes will be rolled up to the minimum value
such that the liability >= a minimum liability. Not supported as yet);
"NONE" (No rollup will be applied. However the volumes will be filtered by
currency specific minimum stake unless overridden specifically for the
channel). The default value is NULL, which Betfair interprets as "STAKE".}

\item{rollupLimit}{Integer. The volume limit to use when rolling up returned
sizes. The exact definition of the limit depends on the rollupModel.
Ignored if no rollup model is specified. Optional. Default is NULL, which
means it will use minimum stake as the default value.}

\item{virtualise}{Boolean. Indicates if the returned prices should include
virtual prices. This is only applicable to EX_BEST_OFFERS and EX_ALL_OFFERS
priceData selections. Default value is FALSE. Note that prices on website
include virtual bets, so setting this parameter to FALSE may produce
different results to manually checking the website. More information on
virtual bets can be found here:
\url{https://api.developer.betfair.com/services/webapps/docs/display/1smk3cen4v3lu3yomq5qye0ni/Virtual+Bets}}

\item{rolloverStakes}{Boolean. Indicates if the volume returned at each price
point should be the absolute value or a cumulative sum of volumes available
at the price and all better prices. It is only applicable to EX_BEST_OFFERS
and EX_ALL_OFFERS price projections. Optional. Default is FALSE. According
to Betfair online documentation, this paramter is not supported as yet.}

\item{orderProjection}{String. Restricts the results to the specified order
status. Possible values are: "EXECUTABLE" (An order that has a remaining
unmatched portion); "EXECUTION_COMPLETE" (An order that does not have any
remaining unmatched portion); "ALL" (EXECUTABLE and EXECUTION_COMPLETE
orders). Default value is NULL, which Betfair interprets as "ALL".
Optional.}

\item{matchProjection}{String. If orders are requested (see orderProjection),
this specifies the representation of the matches. The three options are:
"NO_ROLLUP" (no rollup, return raw fragments), "ROLLUP_BY_PRICE" (rollup
matched amounts by distinct matched prices per side) and
"ROLLED_UP_BY_AVG_PRICE" (rollup matched amounts by average matched price
per side). Optional. Default is NULL.}

\item{includeOverallPosition}{Boolean. If you ask for orders, returns
matches for each selection. Defaults to TRUE if unspecified.}

\item{partitionMatchedByStrategyRef}{Boolean. If you ask for orders, returns
the breakdown of matches by strategy for each selection. Defaults to FALSE
if unspecified.}

\item{customerStrategyRefs}{Boolean. If you ask for orders, restricts
the results to orders matching any of the specified set of customer defined
strategies. Also filters which matches by strategy for selections are
returned, if partitionMatchedByStrategyRef is TRUE. An empty set will
be treated as if the parameter has been omitted (or NULL passed).}

\item{currencyCode}{String. A Betfair standard currency code. If not
specified, the default currency code is used. Default is NULL.
Optional.}

\item{locale}{String. The language to be used where applicable. If not
specified, the customer account default is returned. Default is NULL.
Optional.}

\item{matchedSince}{Date. If you ask for orders, restricts the results
to orders that have at least one fragment matched since the specified
date (all matched fragments of such an order will be returned even if
some were matched before the specified date). All EXECUTABLE orders will
be returned regardless of matched date. Default is 24 hours prior to
current time. Format is \%Y-\%m-\%dT\%TZ, tz = "UTC". Times must be
submitted in UTC as this is what is used by Betfair.}

\item{betIds}{String. If you ask for orders, restricts the results
to orders with the specified bet IDs. Omitting this parameter means that
all bets will be included in the response. Please note: A maximum of 250
betIds can be  provided at a time.}

\item{suppress}{Boolean. By default, this parameter is set to FALSE, meaning
that a warning is posted when the listRunnerBook call throws an error.
Changing this parameter to TRUE will suppress this warning.}

\item{sslVerify}{Boolean. This argument defaults to TRUE and is optional. In
some cases, where users have a self signed SSL Certificate, for example
they may be behind a proxy server, Betfair will fail login with "SSL
certificate problem: self signed certificate in certificate chain". If this
error occurs you may set sslVerify to FALSE. This does open a small
security risk of a man-in-the-middle intercepting your login credentials.}
}
\value{
Response from Betfair is stored in listRunnerBook variable, which is
  then parsed from JSON as a list. Only the first item of this list contains
  the required event type identification details. The runners column includes
  various lists of price information, which may need to be reformatted (e.g.
  converted to data frames) depending on the user's circumstances. If the
  listRunnerBook call throws an error, a data frame containing error
  information is returned.
}
\description{
\code{listRunnerBook} returns a list of dynamic data about a market and a
specified runner. Dynamic data includes prices, the status of the market,
the status of selections, the traded volume, and the status of any orders
you have placed in the market.
}
\details{
\code{listRunnerBook} only takes one marketId and one selectionId in that
market per request. If the selectionId being passed in is not a valid one
or doesnâ€™t belong in that market then the call will still work but only the
market data is returned.
}
\section{Notes on \code{priceData} options}{
 There are five options for this
  argument and one of them must be specified. All upper case letters must be
  used. \describe{ \item{SP_AVAILABLE}{Amount available for the Betfair
  Starting Price (BSP) auction.} \item{SP_TRADED}{Amount traded in the
  Betfair Starting Price (BSP) auction. Zero returns if the event has not yet
  started.} \item{EX_BEST_OFFERS}{Only the best prices available for each
  runner.} \item{EX_ALL_OFFERS}{EX_ALL_OFFERS trumps EX_BEST_OFFERS if both
  settings are present} \item{EX_TRADED}{Amount traded in this market on the
  Betfair exchange.}}
}

\section{Note on \code{listRunnerBookOps} variable}{
 The
  \code{listRunnerBookOps} variable is used to firstly build an R data frame
  containing all the data to be passed to Betfair, in order for the function
  to execute successfully. The data frame is then converted to JSON and
  included in the HTTP POST request.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Return all data on the requested runner This actual market and
selection ID is unlikely to work and is just for demonstration purposes.
listRunnerBook(marketId = "1.178523057", selectionId = 48470)
}

}
\seealso{
\code{\link{loginBF}}, which must be executed first. Do NOT use the
  DELAY application key. The DELAY application key does not support price
  data.
