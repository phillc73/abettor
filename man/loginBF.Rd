\title{Login to Betfair, interactive end point.}
\usage{
loginBF(username, password, applicationKey, sslVerify = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{username}{Character string containing Betfair username and must be
defined. See Examples.}

\item{password}{Character string containing Betfair password and must be
defined. See Examples.}

\item{applicationKey}{Character string containing Betfair application key and
must be defined. See Examples.}

\item{sslVerify}{Boolean. This argument defaults to TRUE and is optional. In
some cases, where users have a self signed SSL Certificate, for example
they may be behind a proxy server, Betfair will fail login with "SSL
certificate problem: self signed certificate in certificate chain". If this
error occurs you may set sslVerify to FALSE. This does open a small
security risk of a man-in-the-middle intercepting your login credentials.
See Examples.}
}
\value{
Response from Betfair will be stored in \code{loginReturn} parse from
  JSON as a list. This will include the statuses SUCCESS, FAIL or error, if
  it is not null, returned as a colon separated concatenated string. Examples
  of login responses for the JSON API interactive endpoint can be found here:

  \url{https://api.developer.betfair.com/services/webapps/docs/display/1smk3cen4v3lu3yomq5qye0ni/Interactive+Login+-+API+Endpoint}

  For error values, see:

\description{
\code{loginBF} logs in to Betfair, via the API-NG JSON interactive end point.
}
\details{
This login function \strong{must be executed first}, before any other
functions in this package. Failure to execute \code{loginBF} renders
everything else pointless. You will require a valid Betfair username,
password and application key. Obtain a Betfair application key by following
the instructions here:

\url{https://api.developer.betfair.com/services/webapps/docs/display/1smk3cen4v3lu3yomq5qye0ni/Application+Keys}

\code{username}, \code{password} and \code{applicationKey} are all mandatory
and must be user defined.

Every time \code{loginBF} is executed, a new login to Betfair occurs. Don't
login more than is necessary.
}
\section{Note on \code{credentials} variable}{
 This variable stores the
  defined Betfair username and password. R function objects are ephemeral.
  This variable dies immediately after function execution. Your Betfair
  username and password is not stored anywhere outside this function and
  details must always be passed to the function on execution.
}

\section{Notes on \code{product} and \code{token} envrionment variables}{

  These two envrionment variables store the session based authentication
  token and product string. They are required for all other functions in this
  package.
