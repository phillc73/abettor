\title{Perform a keepAlive action on the Betfair API.}
\usage{
keepAlive(suppress = TRUE, sslVerify = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{suppress}{Boolean. \code{RCurl::postForm} posts a warning due to a lack
of inputs. By default, this parameter is set to TRUE, meaning this warning is
suppressed. Changing this parameter to FALSE will result in warnings being posted.}

\item{sslVerify}{Boolean. This argument defaults to TRUE and is optional. In
some cases, where users have a self signed SSL Certificate, for example
they may be behind a proxy server, Betfair will fail login with "SSL
certificate problem: self signed certificate in certificate chain". If this
error occurs you may set sslVerify to FALSE. This does open a small
security risk of a man-in-the-middle intercepting your login credentials.}
}
\value{
Similar to \code{\link{loginBF}}, the call output is parsed from JSON
  as a list, from which the status ("SUCCESS" or "FAIL") and error (if it is
  not null) are returned as a colon seperated concatenated string. For error
  values, see

}
\description{
This function essentially refreshes the session token, which prevents
automatic session expiry and allows the user to continue to make calls to the
API. According to the official online documentation, the current session
timeout period is four hours (and just 20 mins for the Italian exchange)
}
\details{
See
\url{https://api.developer.betfair.com/services/webapps/docs/display/1smk3cen4v3lu3yomq5qye0ni/Keep+Alive}
for more information. Thus, make sure to call this function at least every
four hours to prevent session expiry.

\code{keepAlive} refreshes your session token.Unlike other Betfair API calls,
there are no dangers associated with this function- it simply resets the
session expiry time.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
 keepAlive() refreshes the session token and resets the session expiry time
 with warnings suppressed, which, if successful, will return "SUCCESS:"

 The following block shows how we might set up a loop to ensure keepAlive() is called
 within every 4 hours:

 \code{
 start=Sys.time()
 while(TRUE){
 if(Sys.time()-start>14400){ # 14,400 seconds = 4 hours
   keepAlive()
   start=Sys.time()
 }
 # perform some API calls
 }}}

}
\seealso{
\url{https://api.developer.betfair.com/services/webapps/docs/display/1smk3cen4v3lu3yomq5qye0ni/Keep+Alive}
for general information on requesting keepAlive on the Betfair API.

\code{\link{loginBF}}, which must be executed first, as this
  function requires a valid session token
