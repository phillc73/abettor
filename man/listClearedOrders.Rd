\arguments{
\item{betStatusValue}{string. Restricts the results to the specified status.
According to the online documentation, this paramter is not mandatory.
However, it returns an empty data frame unless it's specified. Thus, by
default, this parameter is set to "SETTLED" (matched bets that were settled
normally). Alternative values are "VOIDED" (matched bets that were
subsequently voided by Betfair, before, during or after settlement) ,
"LAPSED" (Unmatched bets that were cancelled by Betfair (for example at
turn in play)) and "CANCELLED" (unmatched bets that were cancelled by an
explicit customer action)}

\item{eventTypeIds}{Vector<string>. Restrict the results to the specified
event type IDs (e.g football = "1"). Optional.}

\item{eventIds}{Vector<string>. Restrict the results to the specified event
IDs (e.g. c("27664019","27664123")). Optional.}

\item{betIds}{Vector<string>. Restrict the results to the specified bet IDs
(e.g. c("61529884133","61529884472")). Optional.}

\item{marketIds}{Vector<string>. Restrict the results to the specified market
IDs (e.g. c("1.122841367","1.122814314")). Optional.}

\item{runnerIds}{Vector<string>. Restrict the results to the specified runner
IDs (e.g. c("1039206","8216044")). Optional.}

\item{sideValue}{string.Restrict the results to the specified side (i.e.
"BACK" or "LAY"). Optional.}

\item{fromDate}{Datetime (ISO 8601 format). Upper bound of date range
(inclusive). Default value is NULL, which means that the latest available
items will be in range. Optional.}

\item{toDate}{Datetime (ISO 8601 format). Lower bound of date range
(inclusive). Default value is NULL, which means that the oldest available
items will be in range. Optional.}

\item{groupByValue}{string. Only applicable to the "SETTLED" betstatus, this
parameter determines how the data is aggregated. THe default value is NULL,
which means that the lowest level is returned (individual bet level).
Alernative values are "EVENT_TYPE" (settled P&L, commission paid and number
of bet orders aggregated over event type), "EVENT" (aggregated over
different events), "MARKET" (aggregated over individual markets) and "SIDE"
(an averaged roll up of settled P&L, and number of bets, on the specified
side of a specified selection within a specified market, that are either
settled or voided). Optional.}

\item{includeItemDescriptionValue}{Boolean. Determines whether an
ItemDescription (e.g. market and event information) object is included in
the response The default value is NULL, which Betfair interprets as FALSE
(i.e. no ItemDescription is returned) Optional.}

\item{fromRecordValue}{int. Specifies the first record that will be returned.
Records start at index zero. Default parameter value is NULL, which Betfair
interprets as 0. Optional.}

\item{recordCountValue}{int. Specifies the maximum number of records to be
returned. To retrieve more than 1000 records (the maxiumum by default), you
need to utilise this parameter. Optional.}

\item{suppress}{Boolean. By default, this parameter is set to FALSE, meaning
that a warning is posted when the listClearedOrders call throws an error.
Changing this parameter to TRUE will suppress this warning.}

\item{flag}{Boolean. \code{RCurl::postForm} returns a warning if there's more
records than the limit of 1000 (or limit specified by the record
parameters) that can be returned in one call. By default, this parameter is
set to FALSE, meaning this warning is not flagged. Changing this parameter
to TRUE will result in warnings being posted.}

\item{sslVerify}{Boolean. This argument defaults to TRUE and is optional. In
some cases, where users have a self signed SSL Certificate, for example
they may be behind a proxy server, Betfair will fail login with "SSL
certificate problem: self signed certificate in certificate chain". If this
error occurs you may set sslVerify to FALSE. This does open a small
security risk of a man-in-the-middle intercepting your login credentials.}
}
\value{
Response from Betfair is stored in listMarketBook variable, which is
  then parsed from JSON as a list. Only the first item of this list contains
  the required event type identification details.

\description{
\code{listClearedOrders} Returns a list of settled bets based on the bet
status, ordered by settled date. For more infromation, please consult the
online documentation

\section{Note on \code{listMarketBookOps} variable}{
 The
  \code{listMarketBookOps} variable is used to firstly build an R data frame
  containing all the data to be passed to Betfair, in order for the function
  to execute successfully. The data frame is then converted to JSON and
  included in the HTTP POST request. If the listClearedOrders call throws an
  error, a data frame containing error information is returned.
