\title{Returns status details for horse and greyhound races}
\usage{
listRaceDetails(
  meetingIds = NULL,
  raceIds = NULL,
  suppress = FALSE,
  sslVerify = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{meetingIds}{String. The unique Id for the meeting equivalent to the
eventId for that specific race as returned by  \code{\link{listEvents}}.
Optionally restricts the results to the specified meeting IDs. A single
meeting ID or list of meeting IDs may be specified. See examples.
Optional. Default is NULL}

\item{raceIds}{String. The unique Id for the race in the format
meetingid.raceTime (hhmm). Optionally restricts the results to the
specified race IDs. A single race ID or list of race IDs may be specified.
See examples. Optional. Default is NULL}

\item{suppress}{Boolean. By default, this parameter is set to FALSE, meaning
that a warning is posted when the listRaceDetails call throws an error.
Changing this parameter to TRUE will suppress this warning.}

\item{sslVerify}{Boolean. This argument defaults to TRUE and is optional. In
some cases, where users have a self signed SSL Certificate, for example
they may be behind a proxy server, Betfair will fail login with "SSL
certificate problem: self signed certificate in certificate chain". If this
error occurs you may set sslVerify to FALSE. This does open a small
security risk of a man-in-the-middle intercepting your login credentials.}
}
\value{
Response from Betfair is parsed from JSON into a data frame of
  6 columns.

\description{
\code{listRaceDetails}returns status details for horse and greyhound races
}
\details{
\code{listRaceDetails} returns status details for horse and greyhound
races in the UK, Ireland and South Africa, based upon meeting and race
filters. Unlike some other Betfair API calls, there are no dangers
associated with this function, it simply returns status details.
}
\section{Note on \code{raceDetailOps} variable}{
 The \code{raceDetailOps}
  variable is used to firstly build an R data frame containing all the data
  to be passed to Betfair, in order for the function to execute
  successfully. The data frame is then converted to JSON and included in the
  HTTP POST request. If the listRaceDetails call throws an error, a data
  frame containing error information is returned.

\examples{
\dontrun{
listRaceDetails() # without any arguments will return results from all available
# meetingIds.
}
\dontrun{
istRaceDetails(meetingIds = "30279213", raceIds = c("30280942.1328", "30280942.1313"))
# returns results from one meetingId and two races from a different meeting.
