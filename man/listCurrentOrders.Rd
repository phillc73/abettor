\usage{
listCurrentOrders(
  betIds = NULL,
  marketIds = NULL,
  orderByValue = NULL,
  SortDirValue = NULL,
  fromDate = NULL,
  toDate = NULL,
  flag = FALSE,
  orderProjectionValue = NULL,

}
\arguments{
\item{betIds}{Vector<string>. Restrict the results to the specified bet IDs
(e.g. c("61529884133","61529884472")). Optional. Default is set to NULL.}

\item{marketIds}{String. A list of market ID strings from which the
corresponding current orders will be returned. Optional. Default is set to
NULL.}

\item{orderByValue}{string. Specifies how the results will be ordered. The
default value is NULL, which Betfair interprets as "BY_BET" (order by bet
ID).  Also acts as a filter such that only orders with a valid value in the
field being ordered by will be returned (i.e. BY_VOID_TIME returns only
voided orders, "BY_SETTLED_TIME" (applies to partially settled markets)
returns only settled orders and "BY_MATCH_TIME" returns only orders with a
matched date (voided, settled, matched orders)). The remaaining alternative
values are "BY_MARKET" (Order by market id, then placed time, then bet id)
and "BY_PLACE_TIME" (Order by placed time, then bet id). The context of the
date filter applied by the dateRange parameter (placed, matched, voided or
settled date) - see toDate and FromDate for more information. See also the
OrderByValue parameter description.}

\item{SortDirValue}{string. Specifies the direction in which the results will
be sorted. The default value is NULL, which Betfair interprets as
"EARLIEST_TO_LATEST". The alternative value is "LATEST_TO_EARLIEST".
Optional.}

\item{fromDate}{Datetime (ISO 8601 format). Upper bound of date range
(inclusive). Default value is NULL, which means that the latest available
items will be in range. Optional. Default is set to NULL.}

\item{toDate}{Datetime (ISO 8601 format). Lower bound of date range
(inclusive). Default value is NULL, which means that the oldest available
items will be in range. Optional. Default is set to NULL.}

\item{flag}{Boolean. \code{RCurl::postForm} returns a warning if there's more
records than the limit of 1000 (or limit specified by the record parameters)
that can be returned in one call. By default, this parameter is set to
FALSE, meaning this warning is not flagged. Changing this parameter to TRUE
will result in warnings being posted.}

\item{orderProjectionValue}{string. Restricts the results to the specified
order status. Possible values are: "EXECUTABLE" (An order that has a
remaining unmatched portion); "EXECUTION_COMPLETE" (An order that does not
have any remaining unmatched portion); "ALL" (EXECUTABLE and
EXECUTION_COMPLETE orders). Default value is NULL, which Betfair interprets
as "ALL". Optional.}

\item{fromRecordValue}{int. Specifies the first record that will be returned.
Records start at index zero. Default parameter value is NULL, which Betfair
interprets as 0. Optional. Default is set to NULL.}

\item{recordCountValue}{int. Specifies the maximum number of records to be
returned. To retrieve more than 1000 records (the maxiumum by default), you
need to utilise this parameter. Optional. Default is set to NULL.}

\item{suppress}{Boolean. By default, this parameter is set to FALSE, meaning
that a warning is posted when the listCurrentOrders call throws an error.
Changing this parameter to TRUE will suppress this warning.}

\item{sslVerify}{Boolean. This argument defaults to TRUE and is optional. In
some cases, where users have a self signed SSL Certificate, for example they
may be behind a proxy server, Betfair will fail login with "SSL certificate
problem: self signed certificate in certificate chain". If this error occurs
you may set sslVerify to FALSE. This does open a small security risk of a
man-in-the-middle intercepting your login credentials.}
}
\value{
Response from Betfair is stored in currentOrders variable, which is
 then parsed from JSON as a list. Only the first item of this list contains
 the required event type identification details.
}
\description{
\code{listCurrentOrders} returns all matched and unmatched bets for all
markets or specific markets. It is also possible to filter the results
according to bet IDs and date intervals.
}
\section{Note on \code{listOrderOps} variable}{
 The \code{listOrderOps}
 variable is used to firstly build an R data frame containing all the data to
 be passed to Betfair, in order for the function to execute successfully. The
 data frame is then converted to JSON and included in the HTTP POST request.
 If the listCurrentOrders call throws an error, a data frame containing error
 information is returned.

\dontrun{
 Return all current orders:
listCurrentOrders()
 Return all voided bets:
listCurrentOrders(orderByValue="BY_VOID_TIME")

 DELAY application key. The DELAY application key does not support price
 data.
